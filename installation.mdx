description: "A guide to install self-hosted version of Coolify on your server."
---

To get started, you need a server, it can be a VPS, a Raspberry Pi, or any other server that you have SSH access to.

<Tip>
If you don't have a server or server provider yet, we prefer to use Hetzner.

You can use our [referral link](https://coolify.io/hetzner). It will helps us to keep the project alive.

</Tip>

<Info>
  TLDR for installation: ```bash curl -fsSL
  https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash ```
</Info>

## Requirements 

### Supported Operating Systems

- Debian based Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.)
- Redhat based Linux distributions (CentOS, Fedora, Redhat, AlmaLinux, Rocky etc.)
- SUSE based Linux distributions (SLES, SUSE, openSUSE, etc.)
- Arch Linux
- Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian)

### Supported Architectures

- AMD64
- ARM64

### Minimum Required Server

#### For Coolify

- 2 CPUs
- 2 GBs memory
- 30+ GB of storage for the images.

#### For Your Resources

Choosing your server resources depends on your usage. If you are planning to run a lot of things, you should consider buying a server with more resources.

Hosting `Supabase`, `Appwrite` or `Posthog` are requires more resources than hosting a static site (waay more).

<Tip>

Here is an example. I'm hosting most of my production stuffs on a server with:

```
- 8GB of memory (average usage 3.5GB)
- 4 CPUs (average usage ~20-30%)
- 150GB disk (usage 40GB)
```

For the following things:

```
- 3 NodeJS apps
- 4 Static sites
- Plausible Analytics (for visitor analytics)
- Fider (feedback tool)
- UptimeKuma (uptime monitoring)
- Ghost (my newsletters)
- 3 Redis databases
- 2 PostgreSQL databases
```

</Tip>

## Installation

### Automated

This works with Docker Engine **(not Docker Desktop, for that, go [here](#docker-desktop-installation))** on any supported Linux distribution.

<Steps>
  <Step title="SSH Enabled">
    Make sure SSH is enabled and you can connect to your server with SSH from your local machine with root user: [more details here](/).

    <Tip>
    If you would like to use a custom SSH port, you can set it on the `localhost` server after you installed Coolify.
    </Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Curl Installed">
    Make sure `curl` command is available on your server.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install">
    Execute the following command on your server with `root` user.

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash
    ```
    > You can find the source code of this script [here](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/blob/main/scripts/install.sh).

  </Step>
    <Step title="Open Coolify's UI">
    Now you can access Coolify on port `http://<ip>:8000` of your server.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**What it does?**
The script will do the following on your operating system.

- Install basic commands: `curl wget git jq jc`
- `Docker Engine` (24+).
- Configures proper logging for `Docker Engine`.
- Creates directory structure at `/data/coolify` for all the configuration files.
- Creates an SSH key for Coolify to be able to manage this server from itself at `/data/coolify/ssh/keys/id.root@host.docker.internal`.
- Install and start dockerized `Coolify`.

### Manually

<Steps>
  <Step title="SSH Enabled">
    Make sure SSH is enabled and you can connect to your server with SSH from your local machine with root user: [more details here](/).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Curl Installed">
    Make sure `curl` command is available on your server.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Docker Engine (24+)">
    Follow the official documentation to install Docker Engine on your server: [Docker Engine Installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Directories">
    Create the base configuration directories under `/data/coolify`.

    ```bash
    mkdir -p /data/coolify/{source,ssh,applications,databases,backups,services,proxy,webhooks-during-maintenance}
    mkdir -p /data/coolify/ssh/{keys,mux}
    mkdir -p /data/coolify/proxy/dynamic
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate SSH Key">
    Generate an SSH key for Coolify to be able to manage this server from itself.

    ```bash

ssh-keygen -f /data/coolify/ssh/keys/id.root@host.docker.internal -t ed25519 -N '' -C root@coolify
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Setup Your SSH Key">
    Add your public SSH key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. This will allow Coolify to connect to this server from itself.

    ```bash
    cat /data/coolify/ssh/keys/id.root@host.docker.internal.pub >>~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```
    <Tip>
    You can skip this step if you already have an SSH key. But you need to add this key to your Coolify instance after installation.
    </Tip>

  </Step>
    <Step title="Setup Configuration Files">
    Copy the `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`, `.e`nv.production` & `upgrade.sh` files from Coolify's CDN to `/data/coolify/source`.

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/docker-compose.yml -o /data/coolify/source/docker-compose.yml
    curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/docker-compose.prod.yml -o /data/coolify/source/docker-compose.prod.yml
    curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/.env.production -o /data/coolify/source/.env
    curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/upgrade.sh -o /data/coolify/source/upgrade.sh
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Permissions">
   Set permissions for all the files and directories.
    ```bash
    chown -R 9999:root /data/coolify
    chmod -R 700 /data/coolify
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Values">
    Generate values for the following variables in `/data/coolify/source/.env`.
    ```bash
    sed -i "s|APP_ID=.*|APP_ID=$(openssl rand -hex 16)|g" /data/coolify/source/.env
    sed -i "s|APP_KEY=.*|APP_KEY=base64:$(openssl rand -base64 32)|g" /data/coolify/source/.env
    sed -i "s|DB_PASSWORD=.*|DB_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)|g" /data/coolify/source/.env
    sed -i "s|REDIS_PASSWORD=.*|REDIS_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)|g" /data/coolify/source/.env
    sed -i "s|PUSHER_APP_ID=.*|PUSHER_APP_ID=$(openssl rand -hex 32)|g" /data/coolify/source/.env
    sed -i "s|PUSHER_APP_KEY=.*|PUSHER_APP_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)|g" /data/coolify/source/.env
    sed -i "s|PUSHER_APP_SECRET=.*|PUSHER_APP_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)|g" /data/coolify/source/.env
    ```
    <Warning>
    This only needs to be done once, when you install Coolify for the first time. If you do it after Coolify has been started, it will break your installation.

    Make sure you save the values somewhere. If you lose them, you will lose access to your Coolify installation and all your data.
    </Warning>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Default Docker Network">
    Make sure the default `coolify` Docker network is available.
    ```bash
    docker network create --attachable coolify
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Coolify">
    ```bash
    docker compose --env-file /data/coolify/source/.env -f /data/coolify/source/docker-compose.yml -f /data/coolify/source/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --pull always --remove-orphans --force-recreate
    ```
  </Step>
    <Step title="Open Coolify's UI">
    Now you can access Coolify on port `http://<ip>:8000` of your server.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Docker Desktop

<Warning>
  This is not recommended for production usage. This is only for testing
  purposes.
</Warning>

- Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for Windows.
- Create a directory that will hold all your Coolify related data. For example in your User directory: `C:\Users\yourusername\coolify`.
- Copy `docker-compose.windows.yml` and `.env.windows-docker-desktop.example` to the directory you created in the previous step.
- Rename `docker-compose.windows.yml` to `docker-compose.yml`.
- Rename `.env.windows-docker-desktop.example` to `.env`.
- Create a `coolify` docker network with `docker network create coolify`.
- Optional: Change the values in `.env` file.
- Start Coolify with `docker compose up` command.
- You can access Coolify on port `localhost:8000` of your machine.

> Coolify Proxy is still not working on Windows.
